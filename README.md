# Projekt

Projekt is a Ruby on Rails application where a user may manage their projects and associated tasks. Tasks are filtered by context so that a user may easily choose and complete a task based on the user's current context. This time management system is based on the popular Getting Things Done methodology created by author David Kelvin Allen.
